# WordleClone
Just a simple, humble wordle clone so now you can play as much as you want.

The game is very very simple, type a word and enter it to start.
The letters are coloured to give you information on the solution. 
Green means the letter is in the word in that spot, 
Orange means its in the word but not in that spot, and 
Grey means its not in the word at all.

You have five attempts to get the word before you lose.
Theres no limit to the amount of games you can play, like there is on many wordle platforms out there.

I got inspiration for this project from the well known New York Times version, which you can access here:
